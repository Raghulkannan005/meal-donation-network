## Abstract

The MealMesh web application is built with React and Vite, providing a modern interface for food donation management. The frontend utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive styling and Framer Motion for smooth animations. The application features a clean, component-based architecture with dedicated pages for donors and organizations. Navigation is handled through React Router DOM, enabling seamless transitions between different sections. The interface includes interactive forms for contact and donation management, with real-time updates and responsive design patterns. Local state management handles user interactions and form data, while constants maintain the mock data for donors and organizations.
